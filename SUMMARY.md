# IRC Client Project Summary

## Overview
This project implements a Python-based IRC (Internet Relay Chat) client with two interfaces:
1. Command Line Interface (CLI)
2. Web GUI Interface using Flask and Socket.IO

## Features
- Basic IRC functionality (connect, join/leave channels, send/receive messages)
- User tracking in channels
- Channel topic support
- Proxy support (SOCKS4, SOCKS5, HTTP)
- Web interface with real-time updates

## Files
- `irc_client.py` - Core IRC client implementation
- `irc_client_gui_updated.py` - Web GUI implementation (recommended version)
- `templates/index.html` - HTML template for the web interface
- `templates/index_enhanced.html` - Enhanced template with user list and topic display
- `test_irc_client_simple.py` - Simple test script for both interfaces

## Improvements Made
1. Fixed the session_id property in CustomIRCClient class
2. Fixed regex issues (replaced \S with [^ ] for better compatibility)
3. Enhanced the web interface with channel topic and user list display
4. Improved error handling in both interfaces
5. Added proper documentation and test scripts

## How to Run
### CLI Interface:
```
python irc_client.py -n <nickname> [-s <server>] [-p <port>]
```

### Web GUI Interface:
```
python irc_client_gui_updated.py
```
Then open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000

## Testing
Run the simple test script to verify both interfaces:
```
python test_irc_client_simple.py
```

## Known Issues & Limitations
- The proxy support requires the PySocks module (not included by default)
- Some advanced IRC features like SSL/TLS are not implemented yet
- The web interface does not support multiple connections

## Future Improvements
- Add SSL/TLS support
- Implement server passwords
- Add message logging functionality
- Enhance the test scripts for more robust testing
